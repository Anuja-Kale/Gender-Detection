Gender Detection Project
Overview
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to detect gender from images. Utilizing TensorFlow and OpenCV, the model is trained to classify images as either 'Male' or 'Female'.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the CelebA dataset, which is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The dataset can be found on Kaggle: CelebA Dataset.

Requirements
TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV
Python 3.x
Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Install the required libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, and OpenCV.
Download the CelebA dataset from Kaggle.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Usage
To use the model for gender detection, follow these steps:

Read the target image using OpenCV.
Resize the image to 150x150 pixels.
Convert the image into a NumPy array and reshape it as required by the model.
Load the pre-trained model 'model.h5'.
Use the model to predict the gender.
The output will be displayed as either 'Male' or 'Female'.

Code Snippet

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Reading and resizing the image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image')
image = cv2.resize(image, (150, 150))
image = np.array(image)
image = image.reshape(1, 150, 150, 3)

# Loading the saved model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')

# Predicting the gender
dict = {1: 'Male', 0: 'Female'}
out_arr = model.predict(image)[0]
print(f'Predicted class is: {dict[np.argmax(out_arr)]}')

Results and Discussion
The model performs gender classification with an accuracy of [insert accuracy]. While effective, it's important to note that gender is a complex and multi-dimensional concept that may not be fully captured by binary classifications.

Future Work
Future improvements could include expanding the dataset, enhancing the model to recognize non-binary genders, and increasing the overall accuracy and robustness of the model.
